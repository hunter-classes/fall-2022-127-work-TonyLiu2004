Hi there, I have no idea what is going on, but I was told to speak like a pirate. My teacher is a cool guy and we are learning about dictionaries right now.
Math class is annoying, I have a test soon and cookies will be eaten.
As a pirate, I will sail the seven seas in search of the One Piece. The One Piece is real!
